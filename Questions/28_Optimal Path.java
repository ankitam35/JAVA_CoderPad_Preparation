/*
** Instructions to candidate.
**  1) You are an avid rock collector who lives in southern California. Some rare 
**     and desirable rocks just became available in New York, so you are planning 
**     a cross-country road trip. There are several other rare rocks that you could 
**     pick up along the way. 
**     
**     You have been given a grid filled with numbers, representing the number of 
**     rare rocks available in various cities across the country.  Your objective 
**     is to find the optimal path from So_Cal to New_York that would allow you to 
**     accumulate the most rocks along the way. 
**     
**     Note: You can only travel either north (up) or east (right).
**  2) Consider adding some additional tests in doTestsPass().
**  3) Implement optimalPath() correctly.
**  4) Here is an example:
**                                                           ^
**                 {{0,0,0,0,5}, New_York (finish)           N
**                  {0,1,1,1,0},                         < W   E >
**   So_Cal (start) {2,0,0,0,0}}                             S
**                                                           v 
**   The total for this example would be 10 (2+0+1+1+1+0+5).
